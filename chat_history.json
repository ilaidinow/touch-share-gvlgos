You want to create an Android app similar to AirDrop on iOS, enabling file sharing and phone number exchange between phones when they are physically close.\n\nHere's a plan for the first version of your app:\n\n- **Home Screen:** A simple interface with clear instructions on how to use the app. It should display the user's phone number and a prominent button to initiate a file sharing session.\n- **File Sharing Screen:** This screen will handle the file transfer process. It should allow users to select files to share and display the progress of the transfer.\n- **Proximity Detection:** Implement a mechanism to detect nearby devices. This could involve using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct to identify other devices running the app.\n\nFor the design, let's aim for a clean and modern look:\n\n- **Colors:** Use a base color of white or light gray, a primary text color of dark gray, and accent colors of blue or green for interactive elements.\n- **Typography:** Choose a modern, clean font like San Francisco or Roboto for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T16:51:59.845538"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an AirDrop-like app for Android that allows file sharing and phone number exchange when phones are physically close.

Users can easily share files and phone numbers when devices are physically close together. The interface is intuitive and follows modern mobile design principles.\n\n**Note:** This implementation uses simulated proximity detection for demo purposes. In a production app, you would integrate with actual Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi Direct APIs for real device discovery and file transfer capabilities."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-24T16:51:53Z"}]
