It should allow users to select files to share and display the progress of the transfer.\n- **Proximity Detection:** Implement a mechanism to detect nearby devices. This could involve using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct to identify other devices running the app.\n\nFor the design, let's aim for a clean and modern look:\n\n- **Colors:** Use a base color of white or light gray, a primary text color of dark gray, and accent colors of blue or green for interactive elements.\n- **Typography:** Choose a modern, clean font like San Francisco or Roboto for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T16:51:59.845538"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an AirDrop-like app for Android that allows file sharing and phone number exchange when phones are physically close.
